<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>I am Andre. I'm just a guy trying to survive in this world.</p>
<h2>Powerlifting</h2>
<p>My goal is to reach a 405 lbs deadlift, 315 lbs squat, 225 lbs bench press by March 2017.</p>
<h2>Ebolaids</h2>
<p>According to my analysis, Ebola is currently in the process of mutating with AIDS into a super-virus I call Ebolaids. Ebolaids threatens the very survival of humanity. I am writing a story about what a future Ebolaids-stricken world could look like. Read the beginning <a href="ebolaids.html">here</a>.</p>
