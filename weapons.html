			The pro-gun control crowd loves to discredit those who entertain the possibility that there could ever be a need for the American people to rise up against a tyrannical government by mocking them as nothing more than &quot;right-wing nutjobs&quot;. They also argue that in the event of an armed insurrection which the federal military would be called to put down, it would either refuse to obey orders and defect to the side of the people or easily quell the rebellion &quot;because a ragtag militia would never stand a chance against the strongest military in the world&quot;. In both cases they argue that an armed populace is useless. First, it is both preposterous and dangerously na&iuml;ve to believe that democracies are somehow immune to being taken over by tyranny. It has happened before: one notable example is how the democratic Weimar Republic turned into Nazi Germany in the span of only a few years during the Great Depression. A population disgruntled with the political establishment, economic turmoil and a widespread crisis of confidence in the nation&#39;s currency as a valued medium of exchange: as unlikely as it seems today, it is not out of the realm of possibility that America&rsquo;s democracy could be subverted a hundred years from now. In this regard, KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov provides fascinating insight into how vulnerable free societies are to ideological subversion and one cannot help but notice how Putin&rsquo;s apologists from both the crypto-communist left and the far-right have more faith in &ldquo;Russia Today&rdquo; and other Kremlin propaganda outlets masquerading as alternative media than any other &ldquo;western propaganda media&rdquo; (by which they mean media in a free society with no 1984-style <em>Ministry of Truth</em> overseer). Making laws require a level of foresight and to take away the people&#39;s arms now when it seems highly unlikely that they would ever need them to fight back against tyranny means to take them away from all future generations which are certain to live under political, social and economic realities different from those of today&#39;s Americans.</p>

			Next, to assume that the US military would refuse to obey orders to shoot its fellow Americans is to ignore how such orders are typically issued. In all militaries, the lower rank you are, the less information you are given. Tyranny is never as clear-cut and when the time comes, rank and file soldiers on duty will not know outright that those men they are ordered to shoot at are their fellow Americans. They will be made to believe that &quot;foreign-backed terrorist gangs have formed as part of a foreign conspiracy to destroy America from within&quot; and that &quot;these terrorist groups must be crushed to protect America and its people&quot; and the government will put all its resources at work to paint the official narrative including the use of agent provocateurs. Also, let us assume for the sake of argument that at the brink of the crackdown, the soldiers see right through the government&rsquo;s propaganda. Even then, it is far from obvious that they will refuse the orders, let alone defect to the rebellion. The individual soldier does not know what his colleagues are thinking, except perhaps his close friends in his own unit. If he defects alone or even with his few close friends without a substantial amount of the military following suit and if the local rebellion is swiftly quelled without sparking a greater uprising, he and his friends will be rounded up, painted as traitors and hanged for treason. We know from a branch of mathematics called game theory that when faced with this kind of uncertainty, the soldiers on an individual level are most likely to comply with the orders and hope that the ordeal will be swept under the rug as a singular instance of terrorist insurrection never to be talked about again.</p>

			Can ragtag militias stand a chance against the strongest military in the world? The Vietcong and the Taliban would have much to say about this. James Madison addressed the question in Federalist No.46. The fact of the matter is that conventional armies are good at fighting other conventional armies, but not so much when it comes to fighting a popular insurgency, where there are no cities to bomb and no clear infrastructure to destroy. Time and time again, protracted hit-and-run insurgencies fought by determined rebels with popular support and bearing only small arms have managed to bleed out and defeat conventional armies that were equipped with vastly superior weaponry. In the case of a future American rebellion, the goal would not be outright military victory as it would be impossible with small arms, but a typical insurgency war meant to wear the enemy down and win by attrition.</p>

			In any case, one does not defect from the military with no actual rebellion to find refuge with, and there won&rsquo;t be any rebellion left after the massacre is over. At this stage, by the very nature of a tyrannical government trying to consolidate its power, a disarmed populace is sheep waiting to be slaughtered and all dissent will be silenced through the barrel of a gun with no chance of fighting back other than desperately attempting to smuggle weaponry over the Mexican border. On the other hand, if it is armed then the initial resistance will buy rebels enough time to engage in missionary work and spread counter-propaganda to mobilize the masses, and this is precisely why having an armed citizenry is paramount.</p>
