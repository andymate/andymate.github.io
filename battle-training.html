<h1>Getting ready for war</h1>
<p>Do at least 200 push ups a day. That's every day. Seven days a week. It doesn't matter how you break it up, but just make sure that you get at least 200. Do a set until you collapse, then a few hours later, do another until you reach your daily goal.</p>
<p>Do at least eighty pull ups a day. Do these the same way as push ups. Just do as many as you can in a set, then come back later.</p>
<p>Run six days a week. Alternate between an easy distance run and sprinting workouts. Day 1, run/walk for thirty minutes without stopping. Day 2, Sprint for a hundred yards, then walk a hundred, then sprint a hundred, then walk a hundred, on and on for at least thirty minutes.</p>
<p>At least once a week, instead of running, load a back pack or ruck sack with at least forty pounds and walk three miles the first time, the next week do five, then seven, then ten, then do twelve, then fifteen miles. After the fifteen mile day, just maintain. Do five miles once a week to maintain.</p>
<p>STRETCH. Do serious full body stretching EVERY DAY even if you missed a day working out.</p>
<p>Working out this was isn't supposed to be good for you, but it has always produced results for military people and when you are in combat, you don't have time to work out. You need all the strength that you can get before you get there, because the stress of combat and the occasional lack of food and sleep cause your muscles and body to weaken. You need to be strong long before you get to that point.</p>
<p>Why do you need all this working out and hardening? Because there will be lots to carry to be a good warrior. Ammunition, weapons, food, water, maybe even wounded friends. Also, keep this in mind, push ups build chest muscle, pull ups build back muscle, ab workouts build that six pack. These muscles do more than you think. Hardened, healthy muscles protect your body's tender organs from shrapnel and bullets. When you have bigger or harder muscles, it slows down bullets and shrapnel and they do less damage to your body as they pass through.</p>
<p>Make sure that you pray if you have a religion and meditate if you don't have a religion. You must find a solace that is unbroken. It is better to enjoy combat and be considered crazy, than to hate combat and actually become crazy. You can fortify this mentality through prayer or meditation. Devote much time to this. Make sure that you think of everything that could go wrong and deal with it ahead of time. If you are mentally weak, then surviving the war will not be enough. Your life will be ruing and you will not be able to enjoy it to the fullest, despite your great service. Think about the paranoia of sleeping in a place that could be gassed at any moment. Deal with that emotion and paranoia ahead of time. Fight to live, but be always perfectly content with death. If you aren't ready, then you may develop PTSD. PTSD isn't caused by what most people think it is. It isn't the killing. It is the stress of the thought that you or your friends could be killed. Make peace with these thoughts. There is nothing to fear, if you die, you have already made peace. Making peace with death increases your chances for survival, that is why I encourage it. If fear, panic, or shock sets in, then you die much more quickly. I encourage you to meditate on this as often as you get the opportunity, make absolute peace with death, in order to strengthen your ability to survive.</p>
