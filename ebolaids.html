<h1>Ebolaids</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p><i>“Ebola and AIDS Virus strains mutate to create super killer virus.”</i></p>
<p>The newspaper’s headlines proclaimed. The newsprint crumpled in the young man’s hand as he scrunched it up and stuffed it inside his shirt, insulation against the rising cold. Life without a home was tough, even in the current social and economic climates. Add to that what most people would call a mental illness, hearing voices and seeing hallucinations, and Ezekiel was your typical homeless bum – minus the brown paper bag with cheap wine.</p>
<p>In his youth, Ezekiel had been a very smart man, finishing school early and entering college a year before his peers. Disaster struck when his parents contracted and became victims of the virus that people were now calling “Ebolaids” the super killer virus that the week-old newspaper that was now keeping him warm against the early winter’s chill, had dubbed ‘A killer virus of super-epidemic proportions”.</p>
<p>Governments all over the world had been calling for calm for weeks now as the death tolls rose to the hundreds of thousands. Physical contact with others, intercourse – even protected, kissing, and other actions involving the exchange of bodily fluids were condemned as ways of spreading the virus. Whole sections of the world’s cities and towns were quarantined off. Panic and riots became the flavour of the day as people barricaded themselves in their homes after looting stores for supplies. Every few hours, Ezekiel would hear a gunshot followed by a scream echoing down the alleys and streets of the city. His body would tense a moment and then the voices within his mind would call out to him, clouding his thoughts, muffling his senses as he descended further into his own madness in a world gone insane.</p>
<p>Ezekiel pulled himself away from the open mouth of the dumpster. The stench of rotting garbage and a dead cat sticking to his already dirty clothes. When his parents had died, all their finances went into giving them a proper burial. They didn’t own their house - they rented, and Ezekiel had to sell off a lot of their possessions just to pay for the cost of the funerals. His place at college was lost while he dissolved himself in his grief, turning to alcohol and his own vaunted company. He was a proud young man, and he had fallen on hard times.</p>
<p>With his place at college, so too, went his home, his accommodation and his future.</p>
<p>He stumbled as he walked down the alleyway. The paper crunching against his skin, the newsprint rubbing off against his sweaty body and leaving imprints of the news on his skin. Rivulets of in-stained sweat dribbled down his spine as he fought the chills that he eared were the start of the Ebolaids virus, but was probably more from the cut that was ripe with infection on his arm. He found a fire-escape door set into an alcove and settled down for the night. It would be cold and restless, as his backpack had been stolen two nights ago when three older men had attacked him.</p>
<p>The knife wound he had obtained stung with the infection that brought him to feverish hallucinations. He shivered as he closed his eyes, stomach growling with emptiness, eyes red and bleary ad his head pounding in pain. He heard the voices murmuring in the back of his mind. He strained to hear them, but their whispers were always just quiet enough for him to not be able to make out or understand what they were saying, but their intent was clear.</p>
<p>Malice.</p>
<p>He awoke several time through the night, shivering with a mixture of fever and fear hearing more gunshots echoing through the dark and abandoned buildings. The terrified screams of a woman sounded near, bringing him to full wakefulness, his heart pounding hard in his chest. Some poor girl was probably getting herself violated. Unable to bear the young woman’s screams any longer, Ezekiel got shakily to his feet and walked in the opposite direction to which they were coming.</p>
<p>The woman’s fate was none of his concern, or so he thought.</p>
<p>The hard panting and thumping of bare feet of someone in full flight barely registered as he rounded a corner. The too-thin body of a young woman collided with Ezekiel, topping them both to the ground. Her body was bare from the waist up and her feet bloody from stepping on broken glass in the alleyway. The curves of her bare breasts were illuminated by a poor streetlight that had seen better nights.</p>
<p>Booted feet ran up to the pair, the young girl scrambling up behind Ezekiel as he stood.</p>
<p>“Please, help me!” she whimpered, crossing her arms over her naked chest. Ezekiel said nothing as three men arrived, their eyes alight with the excitement of the chase. One of them had left his belt undone and the buckle swung to tap at the obvious bulge in the crotch of his filthy jeans.</p>
<p>“Come back here, slut, you’re not done yet.” He leered as he grabbed his crotch in an obscene gesture. Behind Ezekiel, the young woman trembled.</p>
<p>“Leave her alone.” He muttered, his eyes flicking from one grizzled face to the next.</p>
<p>“What, you don’t want to join in the fun?” another jeered at the pair.</p>
<p>“We’ll make it easy, we’ll even hold the bitch down so you can rape her.” The last man sneered.</p>
<p>“Not interested.” Ezekiel said, shaking his head. “Fuck off and leave her alone.”</p>
<p>“Hear that boys?” the man with his belt undone said, his voice low with menace. “He wants us to fuck off without playing with our little mouse first.” He looked from side to side, noting where his boys were before he took another step. He was so close to Ezekiel now that they were almost touching noses. The man’s breath assailed his olfactory senses with its vile stench, smelling as though he had swallowed the sewer water, Ezekiel’s nose crinkled with the stench.</p>
<p>Though he was homeless, Ezekiel always tried to keep himself clean, bathing in the stormwater drains after the rains or finding a water fountain that hadn’t been turned off due to the civil unrest. He narrowed his eyes at the brute.</p>
<p>The man smiled with crooked and yellow teeth before he leaned his head back and head-butted Ezekiel.</p>
<p>Stars sparkled prettily before Ezekiel’s eyes as he staggered back knocking the hapless woman down behind him. She hit the ground hard, and he rolled away just as a heavy foot stomped down where his groin had just been.</p>
<p>Ezekiel’s hand landed on something cold and hard. A metal tyre iron.</p>
<p>“Grab it.” The voices said, clear for the first time. Ezekiel’s fingers curled instinctively around it, his knuckles going white. He scrambled to his feet, the iron dragging on the rippled concrete of the footpath. The grinding noise echoing coldly against the high walls of the buildings that surrounded them.</p>
<p>“Duck, then swing hard to your left.” The voices guided him as the men attacked, the woman’s screams as she was captured again by the other two men becoming faint as his head filled with the scream of white noise, static.</p>
<p>His vision blurred as he stood, then ducked, feeling the wind of his attacker’s fist as it flow over his head. He pivoted on one foot, swinging with the bar, the sharp end used to remove the hubcaps pointed out like a deadly blade.</p>
<p>He felt a slight resistance as the point slammed into the abdomen of his attacker, who went down howling.</p>
<p>The smell of blood entered the play of scents that permeated the closeted street they fought in. Rotting garbage, human and feline faeces and urine, garbage from dumpsters he had raided in the night that stood open, their mouths yawning, and speaking of untold treasures that remained hidden amongst the rotting bags of trash.</p>
<p>Ezekiel turned at the insistence of his voices, taking a roundhouse to the cheek and falling to the ground. His hands came up from the hard cement sidewalk slick with blood. It was not his, but the blood of the man whose life was now draining in a crimson puddle from the hole that Ezekiel had put into him.</p>
<p>The dying man gasped, pulling the one thing that might have saved him from bleeding out, the tyre iron, from his body. He tossed it away, the implement of changing tyres-come-death.</p>
<p>Ezekiel’s body tensed as he felt the bloody iron stop at his fingers. His voices cheered as he again gripped the instrument of death. “Behind you, crouch and swing your leg out, topple him and smash in his skull…” Ezekiel followed the voices to the letter, the sounds of his metal bar smashing into the skull of his adversary.</p>
<p>A sickening wet crunching sound drove him on as the last man released the woman and ran off. He turned and took two steps before he looked at his blood splattered body, the unrecognisable mess of blood, flesh and hair that was attached to the twitching body that lay on the cold ground.</p>
<p>Ezekiel’s mind went numb as his body went into shock. His legs trembled and collapsed underneath him. The bar rolling away from his hands leaving a bloody trail in its wake.</p>
